**Paul J. Ford, PhD** is a clinical ethicist and philosopher whose work bridges the complex ethical challenges faced in neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neurological research. He directs the **Neuroethics Program** within the Neurological Institute at Cleveland Clinic, where he is embedded in clinical practice and research initiatives.

His expertise is grounded in over **2,500 ethics consultations**, including inpatient, outpatient, and research-focused cases. These interactions provide deep insight into the ethical tensions experienced by patients, families, researchers, and clinicians.

Dr. Ford's research primarily explores **qualitative and empirical approaches to neuroethics**, with a focus on ethical issues in functional neurosurgery, device-based interventions, and patient decision-making. He also leads the **ethics core** that supports grant development and research implementation for neuroscience investigators.

He is a frequent reviewer for NIH and CDMRP grants, and regularly contributes to national and international conversations on bioethics. His talks include presentations to:

-   The **Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues** (2014)
-   The **Board on Health Sciences Policy** at the Institute of Medicine
-   The **Neuroethics Network** at the Cambridge-ICM Brain and Spine Institute

Dr. Ford teaches across levels—from medical trainees to community stakeholders—and is passionate about promoting equity and practical ethical thinking in research and care. His outreach extends into local communities to foster **health equity**, **research inclusion**, and **ethics education**.
