***Complex Ethics Consultations: Cases That Haunt Us in a New Era***\
**Cambridge University Press, Volume 2 (2025)**\
*Book Description*: Clinical ethics consultants navigate some of the most challenging cases in patient care, public health, and healthcare policy. The second volume richly details haunting cases pertaining to perinatal, paediatric, and end-of life issues; neurodiversity; disability; and employment of high-tech devices. Authors explain distinctive features of consultations in rural and pandemic contexts and complicated transitions into and out of inpatient care. Cases are grouped together by theme and organized uniformly. Each chapter includes a case presentation, the authors' professional reflections, description of haunting aspects, case outcome, and questions for discussion. Organizational ethics factors into many of the cases. The authors honestly describe the affective aspects of their work, including lingering regrets, doubts, and moral distress. They pay special attention to justice, equity and inclusivity. It is a fascinating and important read for clinicians and bioethicists engaged in clinical ethics consultations as well as ethics committee members and students.\
