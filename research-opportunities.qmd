title: "Research Opportunities"
---

**Dr. Ford and his team at the Cleveland Clinic Neuroethics Program** welcome collaborators, co-authors, trainees, and students interested in the ethical dimensions of neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neurological care.

We work at the intersection of clinical care, bioethics, and neuroscience research, and we believe that the best ethical thinking is collaborative, practical, and informed by real-world experience.

## Who Should Reach Out?

We are open to inquiries from:

- **Undergraduate and graduate students** interested in bioethics, neuroscience, philosophy, or medical humanities
- **Medical students, residents, and fellows** seeking research, mentorship, or ethics-focused clinical experience
- **Faculty or postdoctoral researchers** in neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, law, or related fields
- **Writers, journalists, or science communicators** exploring ethical topics in brain science
- **Community partners or educators** interested in promoting equity and ethical awareness in brain health research

---

## What We Offer

- Opportunities to **collaborate on empirical or conceptual projects** in neuroethics
- Case-based exploration of **ethical issues in device-based neurosurgery**, neurotechnologies, and brain health equity
- Co-authorship and mentorship opportunities with experienced clinical ethicists
- A chance to engage in **embedded ethics**—working side-by-side with clinicians and researchers in real clinical settings

Collaborators may contribute to:

- Qualitative research (e.g., interviews, thematic analysis)
- Manuscript development or grant proposals
- Ethics consultation scholarship

## How to Get Involved

To inquire about opportunities, please send:

- A brief **statement of interest** (1–2 paragraphs)
- A **CV or résumé** (PDF)

to **[Dr. Paul J. Ford](mailto:fordp@ccf.org)** with the subject line:  
`Neuroethics Research Opportunity Inquiry`

If you are a **resident or fellow** considering a clinical program at Cleveland Clinic and would like to integrate bioethics into your training, you're especially encouraged to reach out.

## Not Sure Where to Start?

You don't need a background in bioethics to contribute meaningfully to neuroethics research. If you're curious, compassionate, and interested in ethical questions at the frontier of brain science Dr. Ford and his team would love to hear from you.
