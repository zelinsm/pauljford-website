The second volume richly details haunting cases pertaining to perinatal, paediatric, and end-of life issues; neurodiversity; disability; and employment of high-tech devices. Authors explain distinctive features of consultations in rural and pandemic contexts and complicated transitions into and out of inpatient care. Cases are grouped together by theme and organized uniformly. Each chapter includes a case presentation, the authors‚Äô professional reflections, description of haunting aspects, case outcome, and questions for discussion. Organizational ethics factors into many of the cases. The authors honestly describe the affective aspects of their work, including lingering regrets, doubts, and moral distress. They pay special attention to justice, equity and inclusivity. It is a fascinating and important read for clinicians and bioethicists engaged in clinical ethics consultations as well as ethics committee members and students.\n\nüìò Pre-order Complex Ethics Consultations Volume 2\nüîó Read Complex Ethics Consultations Volume 1, 2nd Edition Online\nüìò Buy Complex Ethics Consultations Volume 1, 2nd Edition Print\n\nGet 20% off these titles using code CEC20 at checkout.\n\n\n\nüì∫ Media Engagement\nüìÑ Recent Publications"
