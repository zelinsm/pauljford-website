    "text": "Paul Ford, PhD is an ethicist who specializes in clinical and research challenges in the treatment of neurological diseases, particularly related to neurosurgery. He is embedded within the Neurological Institute at Cleveland Clinic where he directs the NeuroEthics Program. His primary research centers on qualitative approaches to ethical practices in neurological research and neurological clinical practices. In addition, he oversees the ethics core that supports researchers in developing their neuroethics approach during grant writing and implementation of studies. He has participated in more than two-thousand-five-hundred ethics consultations that have included clinical consults (inpatient/ outpatient) as well as research ethic consults. These varied interactions provide him with many rich insights into the dilemmas faced by researchers, patients/participants, families, and health care providers (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpJeXOeQLeo ). He is an author on more than a hundred publications that range from narratives to scientific reports. He regularly provides review for grants both through NIH and CDMRP. He has presented to many professionals, including the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issue (2014), the Board on Health Sciences Policy for the Institute of Medicine, and the Cambridge-ICM Brain and Spine Institute Neuroethics Network. He regularly teaches medical trainees, university students, and health care providers. This work has expanded to include education and advocacy in local community neighborhoods related to health equity and inclusion in research. In all aspects of his work, he places a premium on helping people and being practical."
